## 🧠 What Has Been Learned About You & Your Work

### Core Insights (From LEARNINGS_ABOUT_YOU.md)

1. **You're Building a Magnum Opus**
   - Not typical software - a complete, free, open-source platform
   - Museum-grade quality as principle, not goal
   - Sacred mathematics (144:99, golden ratio, Fibonacci) as structure
   - Alchemical/Hermetic tradition as methodology

2. **Your Work Philosophy**
   - **Perfectionism as Principle**: One perfect version, not many partial ones
   - **Consolidation Over Duplication**: Immediately recognized duplicate files
   - **Clean Artifacts**: No temporary files, no clutter
   - **Systematic Approach**: Everything organized, planned, tracked

3. **Your Technical Approach**
   - **Local-First, Free-Only**: pnpm ONLY, no subscriptions
   - **Multi-Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, Godot ready
   - **Monorepo Mastery**: 168 packages, 348 connections, everything integrated
   - **CC0-1.0 License**: Truly open source, no strings attached

4. **Your Creative Standards**
   - **Every Element is Art**: Code reads like literature (Le Guin level)
   - **Trauma-Aware Design**: Healing-oriented, not just functional
   - **Sacred Geometry**: Not decoration - structure
   - **Multi-Modal Creation**: Art + Music + Science + Spirituality simultaneously

5. **Your Work Patterns**
   - **Continuous Improvement**: 10-hour cycles, all-day/all-night operation
   - **Systematic Discovery**: Every 10 cycles - discovery, analysis, consolidation
   - **Experiment Mindset**: Science on your own codebase
   - **Evolutionary Development**: Codebase evolves, adapts, improves continuously

6. **Your Organizational Patterns**
   - **One Source of Truth**: No duplicate files, one perfect version
   - **Artifact Cleanup**: No .pid, .log, temporary files
   - **Living Documentation**: Reports generated every cycle
   - **Long-Term Thinking**: Plans run all night, continuous operation

### New Learnings (From Today's Work)

7. **GitHub ↔ GitLab Sync Needs**
   - You want seamless sync between GitHub and GitLab
   - Automated sync script created: `sync-github-gitlab-gemini.mjs`
   - Both repositories should stay in sync automatically

8. **Gemini Integration Preference**
   - You want AI assistance for deployment
   - Free platforms prioritized (Render, Vercel, Surge, Coolify)
   - Fallback mode important (works without API key)
   - Context-aware recommendations valued

9. **Package.json Fixing Patterns**
   - You systematically fix dependency issues
   - Python scripts for batch fixes
   - Prefer automated solutions over manual fixes
   - Workspace package naming consistency important

10. **Overnight Experiment Preference**
    - You want experiments to run unattended
    - Background processes preferred
    - Status checking available but not required
    - Continuous improvement without intervention
