## What Cathedral Actually Is

Cathedral is a **living creative sanctuary** that continues the direct lineage of:
- **Aleister Crowley** — Thoth system, Moon Child (Hierophant as Max Ernst)
- **Dion Fortune** — Avalon realms fully realized, Sea Priestess current
- **Paul Foster Case** — B.O.T.A. color scales, Cube of Space
- **Rudolf Steiner** — Anthroposophical color theory, eurythmic animation
- **Agrippa** — Three Books encyclopedic correspondence system
- **John Dee** — Monas Hieroglyphica, mathematics as mystical practice
- **Leonora Carrington** — Feminine grotesque, Celtic-Mexican synthesis
- **Emma Kunz** — Geometric drawings as healing instruments

### The Core Experience

1. **A Fable-style RPG** with:
   - 22 playable Major Arcana characters (The Fool = Rebecca Respawn)
   - 4 factions based on Minor Arcana suits (Wands, Cups, Swords, Disks)
   - Moral alignment system (Light/Shadow/Balance)
   - Real correspondences, real pathworking, real canon

2. **A Living Grimoire** (Stone Grimoire) with:
   - 8 Chapels (complete alchemical environments)
   - 144 Folios (Codex nodes as pages)
   - Real research sources linked
   - Exportable as printable grimoire pages

3. **The Magical Mystery House** with:
   - 8 rooms (Athanor Chamber, Color Laboratory, Geometry Studio, etc.)
   - Each room has lineage-specific tools
   - Real images Rebecca photographed
   - Design teaching built into exploration

4. **Creative Tools** including:
   - Sound synthesis (Synth Lab) — Solfeggio frequencies, sacred geometry
   - Art generation — sacred geometry, rare pigments, master techniques
   - Design system — luxury minimalist, Case/Steiner color scales

5. **Trauma-Safe Design** throughout:
   - Emergency exit on every screen
   - No sudden sounds, no flashing
   - Grounding exercises accessible
   - Save anywhere, pause anytime

## What Cathedral Is NOT

- NOT a inspiring and engaging tarot app
- NOT a meditation app with mystical themes
- NOT an AI-generated art generator
- NOT a game with esoteric decoration
- NOT a portfolio site with fancy styling

## The Technical Reality

### What Exists (366 packages, 45 engines, 201 libraries, 40 tools, 38 apps)

**Core Systems (working):**
- `codex-144-99` — 144 nodes, 99 gates, all correspondences
- `liber-arcanae` — 78-card tarot with full alchemy mapping
- `circuitum99` — 33-chapter narrative engine
- `stone-grimoire` — 8 chapels, 144 folios

**Game Mechanics (partially implemented):**
- `fable-rpg-mechanics` — Character system, choices, quests
- `fable-rpg-mechanics/factions.ts` — 4 factions with full NPC dialogue

**Design Systems (working):**
- `japanese-design-system` — Luxury minimalist aesthetic
- `master-art-principles` — Sacred geometry, golden ratio
- `luxury-metallics-shaders` — Tiffany-style materials

**Creative Tools (partially implemented):**
- `synth` — Sound synthesis foundation
- `3d-environments` — Three.js/Babylon.js scenes
- `art-generation-node` — Pattern generation

**Apps (need completion):**
- `apps/web` — Main entry point
- `apps/tarot-arena` — Tarot interface
- `apps/synth-lab` — Sound synthesis
- `apps/cathedral-design-studio` — Design tools

### What Needs Building

1. **The RPG Game Loop** — Connect factions, characters, quests into playable flow
2. **The Grimoire Interface** — Navigate chapels, read folios, export pages
3. **The 22 Character System** — Each Major Arcana as playable with unique abilities
4. **The Faction System** — Join factions, complete quests, affect story
5. **The Creative Tools** — Actually functional synthesis, art generation, design

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** for type safety and modern development
- **React** for interactive UI components
- **Node.js** for backend services and scripting
- **Vite** for fast build tooling
- **Turbo** for monorepo management
- **Express** for API endpoints
- **Three.js** for 3D visualizations and sacred geometry
- **PNPM** for package management

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Flowing, spiral-based aesthetics over flat designs
- Trauma-safe defaults: no autoplay, reduced motion, ESC emergency stops
- Sacred geometry compliance: golden ratio (1.618) in compositions
- Consistent mystical theming with energy ribbons and breathing interfaces
- WCAG AA accessibility standards

### Architecture Patterns
- Trinity Architecture: Soul (Circuitum99), Body (Stone Grimoire), Spirit (Cosmogenesis)
- Modular packages with standalone functionality and seamless integration via tesseract-bridge
- Sacred mathematics: 144:99 ratio for calculations
- Component boundaries defined by Open Specification System

### Testing Strategy
- Integration tests for cross-app compatibility
- Sacred math validation for geometric accuracy
- Trauma safety checks for all interfaces
- Performance benchmarks and health checks
- Automated validation via pre-commit hooks and CI/CD

## Important Constraints

- Trauma safety: ESC always exits, gentle defaults, no sudden motions
- Neurodivergent accommodations: motion controls, pause buttons, processing time
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high contrast
- Sacred accuracy: real correspondences, divine proportions, mystical authenticity
