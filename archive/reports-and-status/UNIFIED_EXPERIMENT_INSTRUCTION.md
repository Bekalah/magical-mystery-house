# Unified Experiment - Single Instruction

**Execute**: Consolidate all systems into one unified experiment with working data connections.

## Single Action Plan

1. **Create unified data map** - All data connections in one file
2. **Merge strategic runner into main experiment** - One script with all features
3. **Consolidate all documentation** - One unified doc file
4. **Fix all data connections** - Ensure everything links correctly
5. **Clean up duplicates** - Archive excess files
6. **Verify everything works** - Test all connections

## Execution Order

1. Create `data/UNIFIED_SYSTEM_MAP.json` with all data paths
2. Integrate strategic runner features into `10-hour-improvement-experiment.ts`
3. Create `docs/UNIFIED_EXPERIMENT.md` consolidating all status files
4. Create `scripts/link-all-data.mjs` to verify/fix connections
5. Archive duplicate files to `docs/archive/`
6. Test all connections work

**GO**
