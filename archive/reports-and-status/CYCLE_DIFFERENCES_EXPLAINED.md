## Why Same Data Now?

**Current Status**: Only 4 cycles analyzed (467-471)

All three ranges show the same data because:
- We're only at cycle 471
- Round 1 target is 767 (296 cycles to go)
- Round 2 target is 1367 (896 cycles to go)
- Round 3 target is 2267 (1796 cycles to go)

**As rounds complete**, the differences will become clear:
- Round 1 will show fast, broad improvements
- Round 2 will show deeper, more thorough improvements
- Round 3 will show most comprehensive, complete improvements
