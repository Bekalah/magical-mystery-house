- **Lore**: Real historical sources, real inspirations, real cannon

## Result

A system that is:
- **Elegant**: Flows naturally, no friction
- **Real**: Actual implementations, not marketing
- **Amazing**: High-quality art, sound, science
- **Dark Academia**: Real technology, real lore, real aesthetic
