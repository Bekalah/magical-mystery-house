# Protected Code Markers

## Codex144Engine.ts - generateCorrespondences()

**PROTECTION MARKER**: This function contains critical unified correspondence data.

### What is Protected:
- Unified system mappings (soyga, iChing, kabbalah, evolutionaryAstrology, solfeggio, fractal, fusionKink)
- Flow calculation (high-end Japanese tech aesthetic)
- Aesthetic determination (harmonious, flowing, minimal, dynamic)

### Why Protected:
- Required for game integration (codex-to-character mapping)
- Required for design tools (color palettes, geometries, flows)
- Required for creative neurodivergent mimic tech
- Required for Master V1 integration

### Protection Method:
- Inline generation (no external dependencies)
- Clear PROTECTED comments
- Function names marked as PROTECTED
- This documentation file

### If You Need to Modify:
1. Keep all unified correspondence properties
2. Maintain flow and aesthetic calculations
3. Update this documentation
4. Test game and design tool integrations

**DO NOT REMOVE** the unified correspondences - they are essential for the system to function properly.
