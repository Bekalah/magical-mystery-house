# 📚 Codex 144:99 Library System

A comprehensive library system for managing sacred knowledge datasets and connecting to real-world research sources. This system provides pure algorithmic implementations for the Codex 144:99 mystical framework, completely free of AI dependencies.

## 🌟 Features

- **Pure Algorithmic Implementation**: All research and exploration features use mathematical and data-driven approaches
- **Real Library Connections**: Integration with academic, mystical, and research libraries worldwide
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Sacred mathematics validation and data integrity checking
- **Rich Game World Integration**: Support for Witcher × Matrix × Alice in Wonderland × Jung × American Gods style gameplay
- **Complete Freedom**: Open source, no monetization, community-driven development

## 🎮 Game World Vision

The Codex 144:99 system creates a unique game world that blends:

- **Witcher**: Deep monster ecology and moral complexity
- **Matrix**: Reality hacking and consciousness exploration
- **Alice in Wonderland**: Dream logic and psychedelic transformations
- **Jung's Red Book**: Psychological depth and archetypal journeys
- **American Gods**: Cultural mythology and modern divinity

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cd packages/codex-library
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { CodexLibrary } from '@cathedral/codex-library';

const library = new CodexLibrary();

// Get a specific node
const fireNode = library.getNode(1);
console.log(fireNode?.name); // "Path of Fire"

// Search research sources
const results = await library.searchResearch({
  keywords: ['sacred geometry', 'fire'],
  limit: 10
});

// Validate the entire system
const validator = new CodexValidator();
const validation = validator.validateCompleteDataset();
console.log(validation.isValid);
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Validate all datasets
pnpm run validate

# Search for research sources
pnpm run research "sacred geometry"

# Show node details
node dist/cli.js node 1

# List all nodes
node dist/cli.js nodes

# Generate comprehensive report
node dist/cli.js report
```

## 📊 Codex 144:99 Structure

The system is built around 12 sacred nodes, each representing a fundamental aspect of consciousness:

| Node | Name | Element | Archetype | Game Role |
|------|------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Path of Fire | Fire | The Warrior | Combat & Transformation |
| 2 | Path of Water | Water | The Healer | Support & Restoration |
| 3 | Path of Earth | Earth | The Builder | Defense & Construction |
| 4 | Path of Air | Air | The Messenger | Utility & Communication |
| 5 | Solar Current | Fire | The Leader | Command & Inspiration |
| 6 | Lunar Reflection | Water | The Mystic | Mystery & Intuition |
| 7 | Mercurial Path | Air | The Analyst | Intelligence & Adaptation |
| 8 | Venusian Love | Earth | The Lover | Harmony & Creation |
| 41 | Solar Water | Water | The Alchemist | Transformation & Balance |
| 73 | Twin Ray Mirror | Aether | The Mirror | Connection & Reflection |
| 99 | Angelic Resonance | Aether | The Angel | Divine & Transcendence |
| 144 | Completion | All | The Master | Integration & Mastery |
