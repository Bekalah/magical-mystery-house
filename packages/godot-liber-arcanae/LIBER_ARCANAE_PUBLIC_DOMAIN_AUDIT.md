Even when using public domain subjects, include an "Inspired by" line in credits:

```
Inspired by:
- John Dee (1527-1609) - Enochian magic system
- Dion Fortune (1890-1946) - Avalon and Sea Priestess work
- Leonora Carrington (1917-2011) - Surrealist magic and kitchen alchemy
- Traditional Tarot, Alchemy, and Kabbalah systems
```

### Source Tracking

For every asset, maintain a source entry:

```json
{
  "asset": "character-0-fool",
  "creator": "Rebecca Respawn",
  "license": "CC0-1.0",
  "creation_date": "2025-12-02",
  "notes": "Original character inspired by Leonora Carrington's surrealist themes and Christian mysticism. All creative elements are original."
}
```

### Museum Reproductions

⚠️ **Future Note**: If adding museum photos or scans later, obtain permission or confirm the museum's reproduction policy.

### Photographs and Recordings

⚠️ **Future Note**: If using externally sourced photos or audio, collect written permission or ensure explicit public domain/CC0 licensing.

### Persona Use

✅ **Current Status**: Historical figures are used as inspirations only, not as endorsements. No defamatory or misleading presentation.

## Release Checklist Before CC0 Publish

- [x] Confirm each image/artwork file metadata lists author and CC0 license
- [x] Confirm no embedded EXIF/metadata contains third-party info
- [x] Run third-party asset audit (completed)
- [ ] Prepare Credits scene with "Inspired by" lines
- [x] Add LICENSE (CC0-1.0) file at repo root
- [x] Record verification date (December 2, 2025)

## Decision Log

**Rationale**: Historical figures and systems are public domain; original creative work ensures clean release under CC0.

**Limitations**: This audit assumes current assets are original. Any future additions (museum photos, modern translations) must be re-verified.
