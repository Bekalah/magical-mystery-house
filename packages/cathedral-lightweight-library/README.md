sacred geometry, and creative consciousness converge to manifest visionary works.

Like the philosopher's stone transforming base metals to gold, this system 
transforms raw data and mathematical principles into art that speaks to the 
deepest layers of human experience.


**Purpose**: Expansive but lightweight library system for the Cathedral of Circuits


**Process**: Solve et Coagula (Dissolution and Coagulation)  
**Ratio**: 144:99 (Sacred Cathedral Proportion)  
**Principle**: Creative Expression

**Alchemical Correspondence:**
- Element: Aether
- Planet: Jupiter
- Metal: Copper
