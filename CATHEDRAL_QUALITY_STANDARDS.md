## Visual Aesthetic Standards

### Environment & App Quality

All Cathedral of Circuits environments and apps must meet these visual and aesthetic standards:

#### Core Aesthetic
- **Mystical & Cosmic**: Tree of Life themes, golden branches, celestial symbols
- **Ethereal Atmosphere**: Dramatic lighting, glowing elements, otherworldly ambiance
- **Ancient Wisdom**: Intricate patterns, ornate architecture, sacred geometry
- **Spiritual Depth**: Cosmic connections, astrological elements, mystical energy

#### Visual Elements
- **Lighting**: Dramatic, golden glows, ethereal streams, candlelight ambiance
- **Colors**: Gold, cosmic blue, purple, teal, warm oranges, iridescent gradients
- **Architecture**: Ornate halls, arched ceilings, intricate pillars, geometric patterns
- **Symbols**: Ancient runes, celestial charts, compass roses, sacred geometries
- **Atmosphere**: Dark but luminous, mysterious but welcoming, powerful but safe

#### Quality Standards
- **Museum-Grade**: Every visual element must be polished and intentional
- **High-End Design**: No placeholder graphics, everything must be crafted
- **Trauma-Safe**: Safe to view, no overwhelming autoplay, ESC key exit
- **Accessible**: Works for all users while maintaining aesthetic integrity

## Technical Implementation

### For Game Environments
- Use Three.js for 3D environments with golden tree motifs
- Implement dynamic lighting systems (candles, orbs, cosmic streams)
- Sacred geometry patterns as core visual language
- Cosmic sky backgrounds with stars and nebulae

### For Web Apps
- CSS gradients matching golden/cosmic palette
- Animated glows and energy streams
- Ornate UI elements with intricate borders
- Ethereal transitions and interactions

### For Codex/Arcana Systems

- Celestial symbols and runes
- Cosmic energy flows between connections

## Integration Requirements

All packages, apps, and environments must:
1. **Match Aesthetic**: Follow golden/cosmic/mystical theme
2. **Maintain Quality**: Museum-grade visual standards
3. **Stay Safe**: Trauma-aware, accessible, no overwhelming elements
4. **Connect Visually**: Unified aesthetic across all Cathedral systems
