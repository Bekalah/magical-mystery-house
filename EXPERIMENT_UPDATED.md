# Experiment Updated with New Corrections and Findings ✅

**Date:** ${new Date().toISOString()}

## What's Been Integrated

### New Discovery Tools in Experiment

The improvement experiment now includes:

1. **Comprehensive Discovery** (every 10 cycles)
   - Discovers all packages, tools, apps, engines, systems
   - Uses REAL NAMES from package.json
   - Documents what's complete vs partial
   - Generates DISCOVERY_REPORT.json

2. **Partial Analysis** (every 10 cycles)
   - Analyzes 149 partials that need merging
   - Creates merge strategies
   - Documents what's missing
   - Generates PARTIAL_ANALYSIS.json

3. **Codex Alignment Check** (every 10 cycles)
   - Checks alignment with codex requirements
   - Identifies 702 misalignments
   - Creates fix recommendations
   - Generates CODEX_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.json

### Integration Points

**Contraction Phase (Moments of Doubt):**
- Every 10 cycles: Runs comprehensive discovery, partial analysis, codex alignment
- Every 4 cycles: Runs app completion research (existing)
- Results added to opportunities for improvement

**Expansion Phase (Implementation):**
- Every 10 cycles: Applies findings from discovery/analysis
- Uses merge strategies from partial analysis
- Applies codex alignment fixes
- Creates improvements based on findings

## New Findings Being Applied

### From Discovery
- **217 packages** discovered across 6+ workspaces
- **149 partials** identified needing merge
- **Real names** extracted from package.json (not IDs)

### From Partial Analysis
- Merge strategies for all 149 partials
- Primary locations identified
- Missing files documented
- Dependencies mapped

### From Codex Alignment
- **702 misalignments** identified
- Fix recommendations created
- Naming convention issues found
- Structure requirements checked

## Commands

```bash
# Run experiment with new tools
ppnpm run improve:all-day

# Check status
ppnpm run improve:status

# View discovery reports
cat DISCOVERY_REPORT.md
cat PARTIAL_ANALYSIS.md
cat CODEX_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md
```

## What Happens Now

1. **Experiment runs continuously** with new tools integrated
2. **Every 10 cycles**: Discovery, analysis, and alignment checks run
3. **Findings are applied**: Merge strategies and fixes are implemented
4. **Progress tracked**: All improvements logged with new findings
