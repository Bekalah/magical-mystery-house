# Cosmic Helix Renderer

Static, offline canvas demo for layered sacred geometry. No build step, no network calls, ND-safe by design.

## Layers
1. **Vesica field** — intersecting circles seed the grid (3,7,9)
2. **Tree-of-Life scaffold** — 10 nodes with 22 connective paths
3. **Fibonacci curve** — logarithmic spiral using 144 sampled points
4. **Double-helix lattice** — two phase-shifted strands with 33 cross rungs

## Usage
- Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser.
- Optional: edit `data/palette.json` to change colors; if missing, a calm fallback palette is used and the header shows a notice.

## Fallback behavior
If `data/palette.json` is absent or malformed, the renderer announces the missing palette and uses a built-in calm palette. This guards against harsh defaults while staying fully offline.

## ND-safe choices
- No animation, autoplay, or flashing.
- Gentle contrast with readable inks on dark background.
- Layer order preserves depth without motion.

## Numerology constants
Constants exposed in `index.html` as `NUM` feed the renderer: 3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 33, 99, 144.

The renderer uses constants that echo Tarot and Fibonacci harmonics: 3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 33, 99, 144.

## Numerology as spiral grammar

The wider cathedral runs on spiral invariants:
The wider cathedral runs on spiral invariants: numbers that echo Fibonacci and Tarot harmonics.

- 21 pillars: Fibonacci step (8 + 13) aligned with major arcana and the 21 Taras.
- 33 spine: 3 x 11 initiatory vertebrae; a Christic ladder of balance.
- 72 Shem angels/demons: 8 x 9 lunar decans; sacred multiple of 12.
- 78 archetypes: Tarot deck complete (22 majors + 56 minors) woven into one continuum.
- 99 gates: 3 x 33 triplicity opening to recursive paths.
- 144 lattice: Fibonacci square (12^2) supporting the codex itself.
- 243 completion: 3^5 cube of balance sealing the cathedral.
