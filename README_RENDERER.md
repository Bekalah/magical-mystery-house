# Cosmic Helix Renderer

Static, offline canvas demo for layered sacred geometry. ND-safe by design: no motion, no autoplay, no flashing.

## Layers
1. **Vesica field** — intersecting circles seed the grid (constants 3, 7, 9)
2. **Tree-of-Life scaffold** — 10 nodes and 22 connective paths
3. **Fibonacci curve** — logarithmic spiral using 144 sampled points
4. **Double-helix lattice** — two phase-shifted strands with 33 cross rungs

## Use
- Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser; no server or build step is required.
- Optional: edit `data/palette.json` to adjust colors. If the file is missing, a calm fallback palette is used.

## ND-safe choices
- Gentle contrast with readable inks on a dark background.
- Layered geometry conveys depth without relying on motion.

## Numerology constants
Exposed in `index.html` as `NUM`: 3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 33, 99, 144.
