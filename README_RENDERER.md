# Cosmic Helix Renderer

Static, offline canvas demo for layered sacred geometry. ND-safe and dependency-free.

## Layers
1. **Vesica field** — intersecting circles seed the grid (3,7,9 guidance)
2. **Tree-of-Life scaffold** — 10 nodes with 22 connective paths
3. **Fibonacci curve** — logarithmic spiral sampled at 144 points
4. **Double-helix lattice** — two phase-shifted strands with 33 rungs

## Use
- Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser.
- Optional: edit `data/palette.json` to tweak colors. If the file is missing, a calm fallback palette loads.

## ND-safe choices
- No animation or flashing.
- Gentle contrast and readable inks on dark background.
- Layer order preserves depth without motion.

## Numerology constants
Values exposed as `NUM` in `index.html`: 3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 33, 99, 144.
