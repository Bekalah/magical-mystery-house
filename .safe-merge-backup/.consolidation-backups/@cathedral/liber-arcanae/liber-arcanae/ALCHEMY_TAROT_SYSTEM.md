## The Hierophant as Moon Child / Max Ernst

Crowley's *Moon Child* reimagined:

**Original:** A magical child created through ritual, embodying lunar forces.

**Cathedral Version:** The Hierophant becomes the **Max Ernst figure** — the surrealist magician who teaches through strange juxtaposition. The "moon child" is not a person but a **creative potential** that emerges when the practitioner learns to channel.

**In Practice:**
- The Hierophant arcana teaches collage/frottage techniques (Ernst's methods)
- The lunar current is accessed through automatic processes
- The "child" is the unexpected creation that emerges
- This is the teaching arcana — it shows you how to teach yourself

**Doreen's Garden:**

**The Tower on the Tor:**

- The veil between worlds is thin

**Morgan's Cave:**
- The deep feminine mysteries
- High Priestess advanced work
- Shadow integration space
- Not for beginners

**In Cathedral:**
