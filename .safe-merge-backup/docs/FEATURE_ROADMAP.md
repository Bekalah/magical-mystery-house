## 🚧 In Progress

### High Priority

1. **Enhanced Spiral Dynamics** 🔄
   - **Status:** Partial - needs full level mapping
   - **Progress:** Codex144 has consciousness levels, need spiral dynamics stage mapping
   - **Next Steps:** Map all 144 nodes to spiral dynamics stages, create progression paths

2. **Open Learning Paths** 🔄
   - **Status:** Partial - Circuitum99 has gates, need learning path system
   - **Progress:** Story gates exist, need consciousness-based curriculum
   - **Next Steps:** Create adaptive learning paths based on consciousness, not prerequisites

## 🎨 Cathedral Style Principles

All features must maintain:

1. **Completely Free** - No paid tiers, no freemium, no gatekeeping
2. **Trauma-Aware** - Gentle, supportive, ESC exits, pause anytime
3. **Sacred Geometry** - 144:99 ratio, golden ratio, Fibonacci
4. **Consciousness-Based** - Not credential-based, spiral dynamics
5. **Multi-Modal** - Art + Music + Science + Math integrated
6. **Open World** - 3D immersive, not website-like
7. **Living Systems** - Egregores, consciousness evolution
8. **Open Source** - CC0-1.0, truly open

---

## 📊 Competitive Advantage

### What Cathedral Has That Others Don't

1. **Sacred Geometry Foundation** - 144:99 ratio, golden ratio throughout
2. **Spiral Dynamics Integration** - Consciousness-based learning
3. **Multi-Modal System** - Art + Music + Science + Math in one
4. **Trauma-Aware Design** - Designed for people who don't fit traditional systems
5. **Living Egregores** - Dynamic, evolving design entities
6. **Completely Free** - No gatekeeping, no barriers
7. **Open Source** - CC0-1.0, truly open
8. **Automated Improvement** - System improves itself

### What Others Have That Cathedral Needs
