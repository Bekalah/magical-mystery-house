# Ongoing Improvements - Continuous Alignment

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-28  
**Status**: ✅ Actively improving alignment

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

**Primary Goal**: Continue improving alignment and fixing remaining misaligned content

### Remaining Work:
- **23 high-severity misaligned files** (mostly spatially layered work)
- **18 files needing enhancement**
- **Continue learning alignment patterns**

---

## 📊 Latest Results

### Alignment Status:
- **Total Files**: 160
- **✅ Aligned**: 118 files (74%)
- **❌ Misaligned**: 24 files (15%)
- **⚠️ Needs Enhancement**: 18 files (11%)

### High Severity Issues:
- **Flattened work**: 23 files
- **Bad pages**: 3 files
- **Lame content**: 1 file

### Progress:
- **Before**: 16 aligned, 135 misaligned
- **Now**: 118 aligned, 24 misaligned
- **Improvement**: +637% aligned, -82% misaligned
