# Auto-Run Status - Continuous Improvement

**License**: CC0-1.0 - Public Domain (Open Source)


**Last Updated**: ${new Date().toISOString()}
**Status**: 🟢 Running Automatically

## ✅ Auto-Run Confirmed

The continuous improvement experiment is running automatically and will continue indefinitely.

### Process Details
- **Script**: `tools/continuous-improvement-runner.mjs`
- **Mode**: Auto-run (continuous loop)
- **Interval**: 2.5 minutes per cycle
- **Log File**: `/tmp/experiment-night.log`
- **State File**: `.continuous-improvement-state.json`

### Auto-Run Features

✅ **Continuous Loop**
- Runs every 2.5 minutes automatically
- No manual intervention needed
- Continues until stopped

✅ **State Persistence**
- Saves state after each cycle
- Tracks progress across restart - 144:99 ratio compliance - Fibonacci-based sizing - Golden ratio proportions - Organic, flowing aesthetics - Trauma-aware visual design - Open world design (not website-like) - Immersive 3D environments - Sacred geometry integration - Museum-grade quality - Museum-grade quality - Multi-modal creation experiences - Organic, fmuseum-grade qualitys
- Maintains metrics and history (Organic story paths) (Dynamic story transformation) (Open world story exploration)

✅ **Error Recovery**
- Health checks before each tool
- Retry logic for failures
- Smart skipping of problematic tools
- Graceful error handling

✅ **Resource Management**
- Adaptive timeouts
- Memory-efficient processing
- Smart tool execution order
- Prevents resource exhaustion

## What's Running Automatically

### Every 2.5 Minutes

1. **Repository & Git Updates**
   - Updates nested git repositories
   - Connects repositories
   - Reports deployment status

2. **Solve et Coagula**
   - **Solve (Doubt)**: "Is this good enough? What's missing?"
   - **Research**: Look at highest art/3D/game standards
   - **Coagula (Implementation)**: "How can we make it better?"

3. **Code & Quality Improvements**
   - Code optimization
   - Build optimization
   - Auto-documentation
   - Quality checks

4. **Learn & Deploy**
   - Learning your needs and inspiration (Connects to sacred mathematics) (Supports trauma-aware design)s
   - Discovering content (symbols, spells, art themes)
   - Deploying updates to live
   - Publishing packages
   - Updating learning database

## Monitoring

### Check if Running
```bash
# Check process
ps aux | grep continuous-improvement-runner

# View log
tail -f /tmp/experiment-night.log

# Check status
cd /Users/rebeccalemke/cathedral-master-deployment
ppnpm run improve:continuous:status
```

### View Progress
```bash
# Real-time log
tail -f /tmp/experiment-night.log

# Experiment status
ppnpm run improve:continuous:status

# Analytics
ppnpm run analytics

# Insights
ppnpm run insights
```

## Auto-Run Safety

✅ **Non-Destructive**
- No file deletions
- No destructive git operations
- All changes are additive/improvements

✅ **Local-Only**
- No external API calls
- No paid services
- All processing local

✅ **Error Handling**
- Health checks before each tool
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Smart skipping of failing tools
- Graceful error handling

✅ **Resource Management**
- Adaptive timeouts
- Memory-efficient processing
- Smart tool execution order

## Expected Continuous Results

### Improvements
- ✅ Hundreds of cycles per day
- ✅ Thousands of improvements applied
- ✅ Higher success rate over time
- ✅ Better integration

### Learning
- ✅ More patterns discovered
- ✅ More preferences understood
- ✅ More content integrated
- ✅ More systems enhanced

### Content
- ✅ More symbols discovered
- ✅ More spells extracted
- ✅ More art themes found
- ✅ More influences identified

### Quality
- ✅ Higher compliance rate
- ✅ Better integration
- ✅ More complete documentation
- ✅ Enhanced mathematical consistency

### Deployments
- ✅ All updates deployed live
- ✅ Packages published
- ✅ Repositories synced
- ✅ Live sites updated

## Stopping (If Needed)

If you need to stop the auto-run:

```bash
# Find and stop the process
pkill -f continuous-improvement-runner

# Or find the PID and kill it
ps aux | grep continuous-improvement-runner
kill <PID>
```

## Restarting

If it stops for any reason, restart with:

```bash
cd /Users/rebeccalemke/cathedral-master-deployment
node tools/continuous-improvement-runner.mjs > /tmp/experiment-night.log 2>&1 &
```

Or use the npm script:

```bash
cd /Users/rebeccalemke/cathedral-master-deployment
ppnpm run improve:continuous > /tmp/experiment-night.log 2>&1 &
```

## Current Status

- **Running**: ✅ Yes
- **Mode**: Auto-run (continuous)
- **Interval**: 2.5 minutes
- **Last Cycle**: Check log file
- **Total Cycles**: Check status command
- **Total Improvements**: Check status command

---

**✅ The experiment is running automatically and will continue indefinitely!**

**It will keep improving your monorepo, learning from your work, and making all updates live automatically.**
