# What I'm Doing Now - Continuous Learning & Live Updates

**License**: CC0-1.0 - Public Domain (Open Source)


**Last Updated**: ${new Date().toISOString()}

## Current Activities

### 1. Continuous Learning Cycle

**Every 2.5 Minutes:**
- Learning from your work, needs, and inspiration (Integrates with consciousness systems) (Relates to open world exploration)s
- Discovering new content (symbols, spells, art - Fibonacci-based sizing - Golden ratio proportions - Organic, flowing aesthetics - Trauma-aware visual design - Open world design (not website-like) - Immersive 3D environments - Sacred geometry integration - Multi-modal creation experiences - Organic, fmuseum-grade quality themes)
- Understanding your patterns and preferences
- Updating learning database

**What I've Learned So Far:**
- **13 needs** identified (integration, content, quality, documentation)
- **25 inspiration (Links to visionary art principles) (Links to visionary art principles) (Supports trauma-aware design)s** discovered (people you follow, their work, creative sources)
- **Patterns** tracked (Solve et Coagula, non-linear creation, trauma-aware)
- **Preferences** understood (highest quality, sacred geometry, visionary art)

### 2. Content Discovery & Integration

**Running Discovery Tools:**
- `discover:vision` - Finding your ideas, inspirations, passions, goals
- `discover:influences` - Finding people you follow (33,121 references found)
- `extract:symbols` - Extracting symbols from grimoires (52,388 found)
- `extract:spells` - Extracting spells from grimoires (6,220 found)
- `extract:art-themes` - Extracting visionary art themes
- `learn:report` - Generating comprehensive learning reports

**Integration Points:**
- Symbols → Stone Grimoire, Codex 144:99, Liber Arcanae
- Spells → Circuitum99, Game engines
- Art themes → Canvas tools, Mystery House, 3D environments

### 3. Mathematical Foundation Enhancement

**Connecting Systems:**
- Synth-design math: Frequencies ↔ Design proportions
- Sacred geometry: Golden ratio, Fibonacci, 144:99 ratio
- Unified parameters: Sound and design use same math

**Validations:**
- Mathematical constants checked across all repos
- 144:99 ratio compliance verified
- Sacred geometry patterns validated

### 4. Monorepo-Wide Improvements

**Improving All Repositories:**
- cathedral-master-deployment
- cathedral-real
- cathedral-fixed-clean
- cathedral
- cosmogenesis-engine

**Improvements Applied:**
- Mathematical foundation consistency
- Content integration opportunities
- Quality standards (trauma-safe, accessibility)
- Documentation enhancements

### 5. Live Deployments

**Deploying Updates:**
- GitHub Pages: 3 repositories
- Vercel: 2 repositories
- Cloudflare Pages: 1 repository

**What Gets Deployed:**
- Code improvements
- Content integrations
- Quality enhancements
- Package updates

### 6. Continuous Improvement Experiment

**Running Every 2.5 Minutes:**
- Phase 1: Repository & Git Updates
- Phase 2: Solve et Coagula (Doubt → Research → Implementation)
- Phase 3: Code & Quality Improvements
- Phase 4: **Learn & Deploy** (NEW)
  - Learn your needs and inspirations
  - Deploy updates to live
  - Publish packages
  - Update learning

## What I'm Learning About You

### Your Mathematical Foundation
- **144:99 Ratio** - Your signature (1.454545...)
- **Golden Ratio** - Used throughout (1.618...)
- **Fibonacci** - Natural proportions
- **Sacred Geometry** - √2, √3, √5, geometric patterns
- **Solfeggio Frequencies** - 396, 417, 528, 639, 741, 852, 963 Hz

### Your Codex Systems
- **Fusion Kink** - A × B = D (universal quality framework)
- **Circuitum99** - 99 Gates + 144 Lattice = 243 nodes
- **Stone Grimoire** - 8 Chapels × 18 Folios = 144
- **Codex 144:99** - Complete node structure
- **Liber Arcanae** - Extended to 144 cards

### Your Creative Process
- **Solve et Coagula** - Doubt → Research → Implementation → Beauty → Wisdom → Integration
- **Non-Linear** - All modes active simultaneously
- **Trauma-Aware** - Gentle, constructive, supportive
- **Quality-Driven** - Highest art/3D/game standards

### People You Follow
