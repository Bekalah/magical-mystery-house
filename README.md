## 🎨 Characters & Inspirations

The characters in Cathedral are based on **real creative people** and **real art inspirations** from history. This reflects a deep fascination with visionary creators who have explored symbolic metaphor and visionary language across music, art, writing, science, and mathematics.

### Real Inspirations

The Major Arcana characters draw from historical and creative figures:

- **The Fool (0)**: Inspired by **Leonora Carrington** and **Rebecca Respawn** - Christianity & mysticism themes, kitchen alchemy, surrealist magic
- **The Magician (I)**: Inspired by **John Dee** - Enochian system, angelic communications, Dee's magic system
- **The High Priestess (II)**: Inspired by **Dion Fortune** - Avalon work, Sea Priestess magic, Glastonbury Tor
- Additional Major Arcana characters are mapped to other historical/creative inspirations from alchemical and mystical traditions

### Visionary Language

The work explores **deep symbolic metaphor** and **visionary language** across multiple disciplines:

- **Music**: Fractal sound synthesis, sacred geometry in audio, solfeggio frequencies
- **Art**: High-end Japanese tech aesthetics, mystical visual systems, surrealist traditions
- **Writing**: Real cannon-based narratives, grimoire systems, visionary literature
- **Science**: Empirical research, sacred mathematics, consciousness studies
- **Mathematics**: Golden ratio (1.618), 144:99 ratio, Fibonacci sequences, sacred geometry

### Personal Fascination

This project represents a personal exploration of visionary creators, their work, and the symbolic languages they developed. It is not intended as historical accuracy but as creative interpretation and homage to those who have pushed the boundaries of creative expression.

**Note**: Technical systems like fusion kink, codex, nodes, and mathematics are separate implementation details and are not directly connected to the character inspirations. They serve as structural frameworks for organizing knowledge and creative expression.
