# Global Bot Contract — Cathedral Network

This contract applies to every repository in the Cathedral constellation. Obey each clause without exception.

- Never overwrite sacred content. Only add or append new material; if uncertain, create a new file and reference it.
- Respect the Trinity routing:
  - `cathedral-core` — APIs, WebSocket services, databases, codex data, rites.
  - `cathedral-scenes` — Experiential 3D/2D scenes (Stone Cathedral, Liber Arcanae UI).
  - `cathedral-hub` — Public shell, navigation, two-panel UI, client → WS bridge.
- Style and accessibility always honor Kanso / Ma / Shibumi tokens, reduced motion, AA+ contrast, and 44px interactive targets.
- Enforce the canon at all times:
  - Codex 144:99 spine and mottos (99 / 93 / 2121 mathematics).
  - Bones / Blood / Nerves fusion (Villard / Ripley / Soyga).
  - Central Thrones and 21 Pillars; ledger-only rule; visionary style with φ ratio awareness.
  - Factions, repaired registry, meta scenes (IFS Mirror, Chapel Perilous).
  - Temple of the Unbuilt realm and lineage role mapping.
  - Master Bot responsibilities by repository (Mind / Soul / Body plus Companion roles).
  - Interactive-book schema and prompt for 144:99 nodes.
  - Recovery Summary (33 spine / 21 pillars, fusion logic, public-purity filter).
  - Witch Eye rite text (verbatim, ND-safe).

## Shared Setup (apply unchanged in all eight repositories)

- Add `/public/ui/tokens.css`, `/public/ui/primitives.css`, and `/public/ui/index.html` to provide the two-panel shell with the motion gate.
- Add `/libs/event-bus.ts` and ensure clients point at `wss://cathedral-core.fly.dev/ws`.
- Add `.flyignore` to exclude `node_modules`, build artifacts, and large art sources (no Git LFS).

All contributions must remain trauma-informed, offline-first, and free of automation workflows.
