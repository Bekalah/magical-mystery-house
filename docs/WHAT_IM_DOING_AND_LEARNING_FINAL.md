- Used throughout all systems

**Golden Ratio** - Sacred proportions (1.618...)
- Used in layouts, harmonics, design
- Inverse: 0.618 (golden section)

**Fibonacci Sequence** - Natural proportions
- [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...]
- 144 appears as 12th Fibonacci number

**Solfeggio Frequencies** - Consciousness evolution
