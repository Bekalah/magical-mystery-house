## 🧠 What I've Learned About You

### Your Creative Process

**Solve et Coagula Cycle:**
1. **Solve (Doubt)** - "Is this good enough? What's missing?"
2. **Research** - Look at highest art - Golden ratio proportions - Organic, flowing aesthetics - Trauma-aware visual design - Open world design (not website-like) - Sacred geometry integration/3D/game standards
3. **Coagula (Implementation)** - "How can we make it better?"
4. **Beauty** - Add beautiful, meaningful details
5. **Wisdom** - Extract wisdom from the process
6. **Integration** - Connect with all other systems

**Your Working Style:**
- **Non-linear, multi-modal creation** - All modes active simultaneously
- **Trauma-aware, neurodivergent-friendly** - Gentle, constructive, supportive
- **Highest quality standards** - Museum-quality visuals, 3D environments, game standards
- **Mathematically precise** - Sacred geometry, golden ratio, Fibonacci everywhere

### Your Mathematical Foundation

**144:99 Ratio** - Your signature (1.454545...)
- 144 = 12² (manifestation complete)
- 99 = 9×11 (dissolution through illumination)
- Used throughout all systems for proportions, frequencies, and node mappings

**Golden Ratio (Phi)** - 1.618033988749...
- Used in sacred geometry, layout, and harmonic relationships
- Inverse: 0.618 (golden section)
- Squared: 2.618

**Fibonacci Sequence** - [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...]
- 144 appears as 12th Fibonacci number
- Used for sizing, spacing, and natural proportions

**Solfeggio Frequencies (Hz):**
- UT: 396 (Liberation from fear)
- RE: 417 (Undoing situations)
- MI: 528 (Transformation/DNA repair)
- FA: 639 (Connecting/relationships)
- SOL: 741 (Awakening intuition)
- LA: 852 (Returning to spiritual order)
- SI: 963 (Divine consciousness)

**Consciousness Levels (0-21):**
- Each Major Arcana maps to consciousness level
- Each level has base frequency, quality intensity, complexity factor
- Level 0 (Fool) = 963 Hz, Level 21 (World) = 963 Hz (completion cycle)
