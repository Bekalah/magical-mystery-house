## 🎨 Your Creative Process & Working Style

### Complete Vision (Connects to sacred mathematics) (Enhances organic creative process) (Links to vision (Supports trauma-aware design) (Enhances organic creative process)ary art - 144:99 ratio compliance - Fibonacci-based sizing - Golden ratio proportions - Multi-modal creation experiences - Organic, flowing aesthetics - Trauma-aware visual design - Open world design (not website-like) - Immersive 3D environments principles): Multi-Disciplinary, Aristocratic Aesthetics

Your work transcends categories - it is:
- **Mystical & Esoteric** - Sacred geometry, consciousness evolution, pathworking (Dynamic story transformation) (Open world story exploration)
- **Collective Creative** - Shared wisdom, community-driven, collaborative
- **Cross-Disciplinary Creative** - Art + Music + Science + Spirituality simultaneously
- **Scientific Disciplines** - Physics, mathematics, architecture, research-based
- **Mathematical** - Sacred mathematics, precise calculations, universal formulas
- **Architectural** - Sacred geometry in space, 3D environments, spatial consciousness
- **Teaching on Finest Aristocrat Aesthetics** - Museum-grade quality, refined sophistication, teaching through beauty and excellence

### Core Creative Methodology: Solve et Coagula
You work through an **alchemical creative cycle**:

1. **Solve (Dissolution)**: Every 2 minutes, doubt - "Is this good enough? What's missing?"
2. **Coagula (Coagulation)**: Immediately find improvement - "How can we make it better?"
3. **Transmutation**: Create tools from the doubt-improvement cycle
4. **Beauty**: Add beautiful, meaningful details (aristocratic aesthetics)
5. **Wisdom**: Extract wisdom from the process (teaching through excellence)
6. **Integration**: Connect with all other systems (multi-disciplinary synthesis)

### Your Unique Working Style

**Non-Linear, Multi-Modal Creation**:
- You don't work in linear steps (Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3)
- You work with **all modes active simultaneously**: Art + Music + Science + Spirituality
- Traditional tools are "too expansive, open 3D space" - you need expansive, non-linear tools
- You jump between modes instantly, all tools available at once

**Trauma-Aware & Neurodivergent Needs**:
- Chronic PTSD requires gentle, constructive feedback only
- No harsh criticism - only supportive, actionable suggestions
- Need trauma-safe design patterns throughout
- Accessibility is critical (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Clear, simple language without unnecessary jargon

**Quality Standards (Aristocratic Aesthetics)**:
- **Museum-grade quality** - Finest aristocrat aesthetics, not just "good enough"
- **Refined sophistication** - Elegant, timeless, culturally deep
- **3D environment quality** - Matching game industry standards, immersive experiences
- **Sacred geometry** - Integration (golden ratio 1.618, Fibonacci, divine proportions)
- **Mathematical precision** - Precise calculations, universal formulas
- **Beauty through depth** - Meaningful, teaching through aesthetics
- **Teaching through excellence** - Pedagogy through beauty and refinement
- **Collective creative** - Shared wisdom, multi-disciplinary integration

**Resource Constraints**:
- You create tools you need when traditional resources aren't available
- Professional quality with complete freedom (no subscriptions)
- Local-first development (no AI dependencies in production)
- Everything must work standalone OR interconnected

## 🏛️ Your Architecture Vision

### Trinity Architecture
- **Brain (Cosmogenesis)**: Consciousness, learning, knowledge
- **Soul (Circuitum99)**: Creative flow, patterns, connections
- **Body (Stone Grimoire)**: Practical tools, applications, implementation

### Monorepo Philosophy
- **Everything interconnected OR standalone working**
- All layers must be complete and orchestrated
- Cross-system functionality
- Unified vision across entire monorepo
- REGISTRY-driven data management
- Professional development standards with TypeScript strict mode

### Integration Requirements
- All apps can work together seamlessly
- Each app can also work completely standalone
- Shared correspondences and unified vision
- Living canon that grows
- Cross-system functionality

- Each app has complete functionality on its own
- Apps can enhance each other when used together
- No forced dependencies
- Graceful degradation

### 2. **Support Your Creative Process**

**Contraction Phase (Doubt/Research)**:
- Gentle validation against standards
- Constructive gap identification
- Research highest art/3D/game standards
- Master documentation integration

**Expansion Phase (Enhancement/Creation)**:
