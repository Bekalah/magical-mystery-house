## About Rebecca

### Working Style
- **Preference for comprehensive plans**: Wants to see the full picture before execution
- **Clear boundaries**: Wants clear separation between online/offline, creative inspirations vs technical systems
- **Fascination with visionary creators**: Deep interest in real creative people (Carrington, Dee, Fortune, etc.) and their work
- **Personal exploration**: Projects represent personal fascination, not historical accuracy
- **Quality over speed**: Prefers thorough, well-organized work over quick fixes

### Communication Preferences
- **Direct and clear**: Wants straightforward answers and plans
- **Multiple perspectives**: Appreciates maps and views from different angles
- **Documentation**: Values clear documentation of what was done and why
- **Learning documentation**: Wants learnings about her and her work documented for future reference

### Technical Preferences
- **PNPM-only**: Strict requirement for pnpm, no npm/yarn
- **CC0-1.0 Public Domain**: All code must be truly open source
- **No commercial dependencies**: Strict boundary against commercial tools/services
- **Modern stack**: Migrating to Vite, React, GitLab, Vercel, Cloudflare, Render
- **TypeScript**: Prefers TypeScript for type safety

## About the Work

### Project Philosophy
- **Visionary language**: Deep exploration of symbolic metaphor across music, art, writing, science, mathematics
- **Real inspirations**: Characters based on real creative people and real art inspirations
- **Technical separation**: Technical systems (fusion kink, codex, nodes, math) are separate from character inspirations
- **Sacred geometry**: Core use of golden ratio, 144:99 ratio, Fibonacci sequences
- **Trauma-aware**: Design must be gentle, supportive, with escape options

### System Organization
- **Monorepo structure**: 130+ packages, 22 apps, 200+ tools, 70+ scripts
- **Clear boundaries**: Online (committed) vs offline (gitignored) files
- **Package organization**: Tech items should be in packages, not tools
- **Multiple mappings**: Different views of the same system for clarity

### Current Priorities
1. **GitLab migration**: Moving from GitHub to GitLab, Vercel, Cloudflare, etc.
2. **Tech organization**: Moving tech items from tools to proper packages
3. **Documentation balance**: README should balance character inspirations with technical details
4. **Platform migration**: Documenting migration from GitHub to modern stack
5. **Experiment integration**: Continuous improvement through automated experiment

## Working Patterns

### What Works
- **Comprehensive plans**: Creating detailed plans before execution
- **Multiple perspectives**: Mapping things different ways
- **Clear organization**: Separating concerns (online/offline, creative/technical)
- **Documentation**: Keeping learnings and status updated
- **Incremental progress**: Building things step by step

### What Doesn't Work
- **Rushing**: Quick fixes without understanding context
- **Mixing concerns**: Connecting technical systems to character inspirations inappropriately
- **Unclear boundaries**: Not separating online/offline, creative/technical
- **Incomplete documentation**: Not documenting what was learned

### Common Issues
- **Syntax errors**: Tools with syntax errors cause repeated failures
- **Workspace integration errors**: Need better error handling
- **EPIPE errors**: Process communication issues need graceful handling
- **File organization**: Too many files in root, need proper structure

## Key Insights

### Creative Process
- Work is deeply personal and represents fascination with visionary creators
- Not about historical accuracy but creative interpretation
- Technical systems serve the creative vision, not the other way around

### Technical Approach
- Prefers modern, free, open-source tools
- Values type safety and proper organization
- Wants clear boundaries and separation of concerns
- Appreciates automation and continuous improvement

### Documentation Needs
- Wants clear documentation of what exists and where
- Values multiple perspectives and mappings
- Needs learnings documented for future reference
- Prefers consolidated, organized documentation

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Always create comprehensive plans** before starting work
2. **Maintain clear boundaries** between creative inspirations and technical systems
3. **Document learnings** about Rebecca and her work
4. **Organize files properly** with clear online/offline separation
5. **Map things multiple ways** for different perspectives
6. **Fix errors immediately** to prevent accumulation
7. **Balance documentation** between creative and technical aspects
