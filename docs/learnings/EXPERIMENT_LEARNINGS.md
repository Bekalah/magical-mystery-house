# Experiment Learnings


# ⚗️ EXPERIMENT_LEARNINGS

**In the alchemical tradition, this grimoire contains the sacred knowledge**
**and principles that guide the transformation of base materials into gold.**

---

**Created**: December 3, 2025  
**Purpose**: Document what the experiment has learned about the work and the system

---

## System Learnings

### Tech Organization
- **Discovery**: Tech items created during experiment were in `tools/` directory
- **Learning**: Tech items should be integrated into proper packages, not left as tools
- **Action**: Created packages for tech items (PortalTech, RPGTech, TrueWillTech)
- **Result**: Better organization, proper exports, type safety

### Error Patterns
- **Discovery**: 905 workspace integration errors, 478 EPIPE errors
- **Learning**: Errors accumulate if not fixed immediately
- **Action**: Added auto-fix at start of cycles, better error handling
- **Result**: Reduced error accumulation, better recovery

### File Organization
- **Discovery**: 100+ documentation/report files in root directory
- **Learning**: Need clear online/offline boundaries
- **Action**: Created directory structure with online/offline separation
- **Result**: Better organization, clearer boundaries

---

## Work Learnings

### Character System
- **Discovery**: Characters are based on real creative people (Carrington, Dee, Fortune)
- **Learning**: This is a personal fascination with visionary creators
- **Action**: Documented character inspirations in README and maps
- **Result**: Clear separation between creative inspirations and technical systems

### Visionary Language
- **Discovery**: Work explores symbolic metaphor across music, art, writing, science, math
- **Learning**: This is core to the creative vision
- **Action**: Created visionary language map
- **Result**: Better understanding of cross-disciplinary connections

### Platform Migration
- **Discovery**: Migrating from GitHub to modern stack (GitLab, Vercel, Cloudflare, etc.)
- **Learning**: Migration is in progress, needs documentation
- **Action**: Created platform migration documentation and maps
- **Result**: Clear migration status and path forward

---

## Technical Learnings

### Package Structure
- **Discovery**: 130+ packages need proper organization
- **Learning**: Tech items should be in packages, not tools
- **Action**: Integrated tech items into packages
- **Result**: Better package structure, proper exports

### Build System
- **Discovery**: Migrating to Vite for faster builds
- **Learning**: Modern build tools improve developer experience
- **Action**: Configured Vite, React, TypeScript
- **Result**: Faster builds, better hot reload

### CI/CD
- **Discovery**: GitLab CI/CD provides better monorepo support
- **Learning**: Modern CI/CD is more flexible
- **Action**: Configured GitLab CI/CD with dynamic release tags
- **Result**: Better deployment pipeline

---

## Process Learnings

### Experiment Patterns
- **Discovery**: Experiment runs in cycles with contraction/expansion phases
- **Learning**: Regular checks prevent issues from accumulating
- **Action**: Added new cycle tasks for character checks, platform checks, tech integration
- **Result**: More comprehensive improvement coverage

### Documentation Patterns
- **Discovery**: Multiple documentation files needed consolidation
- **Learning**: Maps from different perspectives provide clarity
- **Action**: Created multiple mapping documents
- **Result**: Better understanding of system from different angles

### Error Handling
- **Discovery**: EPIPE and workspace integration errors are common
- **Learning**: Need graceful error handling, not just try-catch
- **Action**: Added timeout handling, better process communication
- **Result**: More robust error recovery

---

## Future Improvements

### Immediate
- Complete tech item integration (WitchEyeTech, WitchModTech, DoubleTreePathworkingTech)
- Finish platform migration documentation
- Complete file organization (move files to proper directories)

### Short Term
- Update all TECH_INTEGRATION.json files
- Archive original tech tools
- Update all package references

### Long Term
- Run experiment to gather more learnings
- Continue improving based on learnings
- Document patterns as they emerge
