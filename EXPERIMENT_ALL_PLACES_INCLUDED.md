# Experiment Updated - ALL Found Places Included ✅

**Date:** ${new Date().toISOString()}

## What's Been Updated

### Comprehensive Discovery Enhanced
- **Dynamic workspace discovery** - Automatically finds ALL cathedral workspaces
- **Scans ALL workspaces** - Not just hardcoded list
- **Includes ALL found places** - Every package, tool, app, engine, system from every workspace

### Experiment Integration Enhanced

**Contraction Phase (Every 10 cycles):**
- Runs comprehensive discovery across ALL workspaces
- Loads and uses ALL findings from discovery report
- Creates opportunities from ALL partials, incomplete packages, misalignments
- Includes summary statistics from ALL workspaces

**Expansion Phase (Every 10 cycles):**
- Applies merge strategies from ALL partials (up to 3 per cycle)
- Applies codex alignment fixes from ALL misalignments (up to 3 per cycle)
- Completes incomplete packages from ALL workspaces (up to 3 per cycle)
- Tracks remaining work across ALL workspaces

## Current Discovery Results

From ALL found places:
- **217 packages** across 4+ workspaces
- **9 tools** discovered
- **63 apps** discovered
- **54 engines** discovered
- **62 systems** discovered
- **149 partials** needing merge
- **131 incomplete packages** needing completion

## Workspaces Included

1. cathedral-master-deployment
2. cathedral-real
3. cathedral-fixed-clean
4. Roo-Code
5. (Plus any dynamically discovered cathedral workspaces)

## What Happens Now

Every 10 cycles, the experiment:
1. **Discovers ALL workspaces** (including dynamically found ones)
2. **Scans ALL packages** in all workspaces
3. **Analyzes ALL partials** from all workspaces
4. **Checks ALL entities** for codex alignment
5. **Applies fixes** from ALL findings across ALL workspaces

## Integration Details

### Discovery Integration
- Loads DISCOVERY_REPORT.json after discovery
- Extracts summary statistics from ALL workspaces
- Creates opportunities based on ALL found entities
- Tracks incomplete packages from ALL workspaces

### Partial Analysis Integration
- Loads PARTIAL_ANALYSIS.json after analysis
- Applies merge strategies from ALL partials
- Processes up to 3 strategies per cycle (rotates through all)
- Tracks remaining partials across ALL workspaces

### Codex Alignment Integration
- Loads CODEX_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.json after check
- Applies fixes from ALL misalignments
- Processes up to 3 recommendations per cycle (rotates through all)
- Tracks remaining misalignments across ALL workspaces

## Commands

```bash
# Run discovery across ALL workspaces
ppnpm run discover:all

# Run full analysis (discovery + partials + codex)
ppnpm run discover:full

# Check experiment status
ppnpm run improve:status
```
