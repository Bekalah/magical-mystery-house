In the alchemical tradition, this system serves as a crucible where mathematics, 
sacred geometry, and creative consciousness converge to manifest visionary works.

Like the philosopher's stone transforming base metals to gold, this system 
transforms raw data and mathematical principles into art that speaks to the 
deepest layers of human experience.


**Purpose**: Game Design Engine - Interactive Experiences & RPG Mechanics for Cathedral


**Process**: Solve et Coagula (Dissolution and Coagulation)  
**Ratio**: 144:99 (Sacred Cathedral Proportion)  
**Principle**: Creative Expression

**Alchemical Correspondence:**
- Element: Earth
- Planet: Saturn
- Metal: Lead
- Symbol: ♄

**Interactive Experiences & RPG Mechanics Engine**

Creates game design frameworks from Codex144 nodes, integrating RPG elements, interactive mechanics, and consciousness-based gameplay.

## Features

- Game mechanics (exploration, combat, puzzle, narrative)
- RPG elements (character, location, ability, quest)
- Interaction types (text-based, point-click, gesture, immersive-3d, multi-modal)
- Play styles (open-world, sandbox, narrative-driven, exploration-focused, creative)
- Reward structures and progression systems
- Balance analysis and player experience optimization

## Usage

```typescript
import { GameDesignEngine } from '@cathedral/game-design-core';

const engine = new GameDesignEngine();
const gameNode = engine.createGameNode(42);
```
